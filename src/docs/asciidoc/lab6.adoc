= Lab 6: Using SCDF (server local and shell)

== Prerequisites

. <<lab5,Lab 5>> executed.

== Step 1 - Download Spring Cloud Data Flow jars (server-local and shell)

I clicked on `{scdf-tutorial-windows-dir}\files\get-lab6-jars.sh`.
This script only executes the following commands to download the two jars needed by this lab:

----
include::{projectdir}/files/get-lab6-jars.sh[]
----

== Step 2 - Start Spring Cloud Data Flow (server-local and shell)

I clicked `spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local.bat` to start SCDF local with the following command:

----
include::{projectdir}/files/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local.bat[]
----

After that, I also clicked on `spring-cloud-dataflow-shell.bat`.
This script started SCDF shell through the following command:

----
include::{projectdir}/files/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell.bat[]
----

== Step 3 - Register applications, create and deploy a stream

I typed the following commands on shell:

----
include::{projectdir}/files/spring-shell.log.history[]
----

== Step 4 - Monitor the stream log

I noticed the following log output on `spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local` window:

----
include::{projectdir}/files/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local.log[]
----

So, I opened Git Bash to run the `tail` command in background and monitor the log output with the following command:

----
tail -f "C:\Users\user1\AppData\Local\Temp\spring-cloud-deployer-7284336212701312273\httpIngest-1526842618079\httpIngest.log\stdout_0.log" &
----

I repeat the `curl` command that I did last lab:

----
curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"id":"1","temperature":"100"}' http://localhost:8123/data
----

I noticed an output like this:

----
2018-05-... WARN 4222 --- [tp.httpIngest-1] log-sink                                 : {"id":"1","temperature":"100"}
----

== Step 5 - Accessing the Graphical UI Dashboard

After many steps did by using a command line, I wanted to see some graphical user interface.
I pointed my brower to the dashboard: http://localhost:9393/dashboard.

NOTE: The Microsoft Edge browser had some CSS problems when I opened the dashboard with it. So, I switched to Firefox.

By opening the dashboard I saw the tab `Apps` where I all the apps were registered.
This tab provides the ability to register or unregister applications.

== Step 6 - Inspecting the tabs

By clicking on a application (like `http`) I could see its properties:

The `Runtime` tab shows the list of all running apps:

By clicking on the app `httpIngest.log` I also saw the `stdout` path.

The `Streams` tab list all the stream definitions and provides the ability to deploy/deploy or destroy streams:

I could expand the stream definition:

The `Tasks` tab will be discussed on a next lab.

The `Jobs` tab will be discussed on a next lab.

The most left tab (`About`) is where I could get information about SCDF:

I destroyed the created stream (`httpIngest`) using the UI:

== Step 7 - Backing to the shell

I checked if the stream was really destroyed by using the shell with the following command:

----
stream list
----

I typed the followed commands to unregister the applications:

----
app list
app unregister --type source --name http
app unregister --type sink --name log
----

Backing to the UI, I could check that I had no registered apps anymore:

I left the windows that I opened (`spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local.bat` and `spring-cloud-dataflow-shell.bat`) running in order to continue the next lab.
