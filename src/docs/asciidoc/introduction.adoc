= Introduction

Recently I had work to produce a document with a comparison between two tools for Cloud Data Flow.
I didn't have any knowledge of this kind of technology before creating this document.
{spring-cloud-dataflow} (SCDF) is one of the tools in my comparison document.
So, here I describe my own procedures to learn about SCDF and take my own preliminary conclusions.
I followed many steps on my own desktop (a MacBook Pro computer) to accomplish this task.
This document shows you what I did.

Basically, to learn about SCDF in order to do a comparison with other tool:

* I saw some <<videos,videos>> about it.
* I wrote my own labs:
** <<lab1,{lab1-title}>>
** <<lab2,{lab2-title}>>
** <<lab3,{lab3-title}>>
** <<lab4,{lab4-title}>>
** <<lab5,{lab5-title}>>
** <<lab6,{lab6-title}>>
** <<lab7,{lab7-title}>>

In these labs, I only used command line tools.
This approach was very simple for me because I have to much experience in tools like Bash and GNU commands.
I didnÂ´t use any IDE (like {uri-spring-tool-suite}[Spring Tool Suite]).
I know that this could make all the process even simpler for developers without command line experience.
But, my focus was on the technologies itself.
So for me, a command line approach showed me in deeper concepts that I wanted to learn.
